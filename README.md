# 😊😳Two Truths, 🤥🤭One Lie Game!

## 🎯Goal

This project is meant to be a fun portfolio piece, which will demonstrate you know some VueJS, and introduce you to future friends and gigs.

## 📖Background

My tech squad, [Cherry on Tech](https://cherryon.tech), is working on learning several different technologies. Some of them are looking for jobs, and would like a way to introduce themselves to future friends, colleagues, and bosses. This seemed like a good way to demonstrate a knowledge of a technology, and have some fun in the process! I went first with VueJS, and they will be creating this same game in their chosen technologies, so stay tuned!
